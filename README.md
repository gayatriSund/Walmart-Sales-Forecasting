•	Pandas
•	NumPy
•	Matplotlib
•	Statsmodels
•	TensorFlow / Keras
•	Scikit-learn
•	SQL

📊 SQL Analysis Performed:

•	Data filtering (WHERE)
•	Aggregation (GROUP BY)
•	Store-level sales analysis
•	Revenue trend insights

📈 Time Series Modeling

•	ARIMA
•	Used after differencing to handle non-stationary data.
•	SARIMA
•	Captured seasonality in weekly sales data effectively.
•	LSTM
•	Implemented deep learning model for sequential forecasting.

📉 Model Evaluation

•	Metric Used: RMSE
•	SARIMA showed better performance due to seasonal pattern handling.


🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates:
•	End-to-end data analysis
